Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

   Python has vast application in various domains like Data science,Data Analytics
 web development and Machine learning and many more, hence it is called as general purpose.
 and it is a programming language which is human readable hence it is a high level programming language.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

   In python the values will be stored in memory randomly irrespective of its data type and 
variable name will bind with the memory location. There is no need to declare the data type 
to the variable

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

  	pros                               cons

	1.Easy to understand              1.Indentation 
	2.Vast applications  		    2.High memory consumption
 	 Ex. Data science,
      	web development
	3.Open source			    3.Complex multi threding
	4.Huge set of libraries           4.Dynamically typed
	5.Large Community                 5.Security

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?


Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

int_num = int(input("Enter the number"))
if int_num % 2 == 0:
    print(int_num," is Even")
else:
    print(int_num, " is odd" ) 

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

		age = int(input("Enter your age"))

		if age >= 18:
   		    print("I can vote")
		else:
    		    print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

code:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
x = 0
for i in numbers:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        x += i
print("sum of even numbers in the list is",x)
